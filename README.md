# Triple Espresso

## Project Overview 📊

Triple Espresso is a front-end web project developed to simulate a fictional coffee shop website. The main goal of this project is to practice semantic HTML, structured CSS architecture, and version control using Git and GitHub. The page focuses on clear navigation, visual identity, and user-friendly layout, resembling a real-world business website. The project was built without JavaScript, emphasizing solid fundamentals in HTML and CSS, along with the BEM methodology for scalable and maintainable styling.

## Features ✨

• Semantic and well-structured HTML layout
• Responsive and organized styling using CSS
• Navigation menu linked to key sections of the page
• Reservation section with a table booking form
• Recipes section to increase user engagement
• Footer with visual identity and social media links
• Clean and scalable CSS architecture using BEM

## Technologies Used 🛠️

• HTML5 – semantic structure and content organization
• CSS3 – layout, responsiveness, and visual styling
• BEM Methodology – structured and maintainable CSS naming
• Git & GitHub – version control and project management

## Project Structure 🗂️

• index.html – main page structure
• blocks/ – CSS blocks following BEM methodology
• pages/ – page-specific styles
• images/ – image assets used throughout the project

## How to Run the Project ▶️

• Clone or download the repository  
• Open index.html in your browser

Optional (recommended):  
• Run a local server (e.g. VS Code Live Server) to avoid path issues and better simulate a real environment

## Project Status 📌
